# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file starts at 0.2.0; earlier releases (0.1.0, 0.1.1) predate it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Role-routed models: the `rigorquant.models` settings namespace maps every
  RigorQuant role to a primary and a fallback model, each with its own
  reasoning effort, and the router rewrites `agent/request` per role. Roles are
  identified by a `[[rq:role=...]]` tag in the preset persona, so sessions on
  other presets — and forks, workflow workers, and ralph children — are never
  touched.
- A browser half (`dsh/client.js`) serving that namespace as a card in
  Settings -> Plugins, with a per-role primary/fallback selection and a
  per-choice reasoning effort.
- `tests/test_client_bundle.py` and its Node probe: the browser half is
  executed the way the web shell executes it, covering the four contracts a
  client bundle has to satisfy (loader registration, cordis surface, slot
  registration, and render under framework-composed props). Nothing in this
  repository could catch a browser-half defect before.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- A single, tested meta-validator (rq_check.py) shipped inside the rigorquant
  skill, loading the JSON Schemas that sit beside it, so the schema and the
  checker cannot drift apart.
- The validator's test suite (tests/, 66 tests) and CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml):
  a forged study that must FAIL, plus repo-consistency assertions that replace
  human re-reading with executable checks.
- Machine enforcement for the honesty gate: evidence is read from
  audits/, derivations/, artifacts/ (never study.json), the registry is parsed
  rather than grepped, and a domain-scale instance that names only a
  special/reference body (box/ball/simplex/ellipsoid/diagonal) or restates a
  simplified case is refused.

### Changed
- Moved rq_check.py and the JSON Schemas into
  agent-presets/rigorquant/skills/rigorquant/ (the single canonical location);
  the old repo-root scripts/ and schemas/ are removed.
- The validator is stricter: a study that previously received a false PASS (empty
  stage outputs, a decorative "passed", a self-vouching report, a non-study-root
  output path) is now refused.
- package.json now ships tests/; the npm package no longer includes generated
  __pycache__/*.pyc.
- Docs re-anchored to <skill-dir>; layout wording corrected ("not shipped in the
  npm bundle" instead of "untracked").

### Fixed
- TeX compile: the discovered engine's directory is now put on PATH so latexmk
  can launch pdflatex on MacTeX installs (previously valid studies were refused
  with a false compile failure).
- The no-overclaim rule now covers all four evidence levels, not only
  "formally verified".
- Documented the reopened-status rule: a status that begins with PASS but is
  marked reopened is no longer a PASS claim (previously an undocumented escape
  hatch).
